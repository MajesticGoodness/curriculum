I have now created my own 'teach yourself CS' workshop <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/software.html">here</a> where many of the materials from this page I slip into there as needed. 
</p>

<p>
This is a collection of modern resources on various undergrad level computer science topics that I've used at one point or another so included them here. Use <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/">WorldCat</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">LibGen</a> if you can't buy these books. You don't have to do everything here, just whatever interests you.

Are you a professor/TA somewhere reading this and wondering how you can take your school course and open it up to the public more without breaking all the academic integrity rules? Consider some host that has a generous free tier with persistence/dbms like fly.io and write grading scripts similar to the grading used in <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/">CSCI 0190</a> at Brown University where TAs extract student tests and run them against buggy implementations of algorithms they've created to see if they understand the problem domain. If the tests fail return the input that made it fail so they can figure it out themselves. That way you can retain secret assignments and aren't giving away full solutions while randoms on the internet like myself learn to think through the entire problem domain. 
</p>

<p>
Many of the assignments involve relations instead of functions meaning one program can map to many different correct outputs like shortest-path algorithms so students create their own testing oracles where they write two implementations of the same algorithm (Kruskal and Prim MST algo for example) and random graph inputs are generated with ouputs compared to ensure correctness. You could write these algorithms yourself but introduce subtle bugs that would only be caught if the student oracles are correct forcing a kind of property-based testing on students like they do at Brown. This can all be automated and you get to choose the random inputs size plus the running time complexity of the algorithms so you aren't using up too many resources. The <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/">professors</a> and TAs at Brown used 'lightweight' formal modeling tools like Pardinus/Alloy and recently their own tool <a href="https://csci1710.github.io/forge-documentation/">Forge</a> to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/nrsdwk-auto-targ-test-pbt-pred/">create</a> bugs that exploit student misconceptions and none of them are gotcha style extremal cases or anything silly. 
</p>

<p>
When I started out I found this Brown U style much harder and more educational than the junk scripts I banged off solving dozens of exercises in introductory books and courses such as 'write your own version of X to allow this feature' well my junk version of X is always going to pass my junk test suite and I'd move on.
</p>

<p>
To make videos you have control over can do a simple asciicast like Prof Prabhakar Ragde does <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/747/notes/Induction.html#%28part._.Building_proofs_interactively%29">here</a> to show programming in Agda. No YouTube <a href="https://obsproject.com/">studio</a> setup is needed or voice recording even if you don't want/have time.

<h3 id="org2ae4f42">Studying Strategies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2ae4f42">
<p>
On Isaac Newton's iteration method to self-learn geometry:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"He bought Descartes' Geometry and read it by himself .. when he was got over 2 or 3 pages he could understand no farther, than he began again and got 3 or 4 pages father till he came to another difficult place, than he began again and advanced farther and continued so doing till he made himself master of the whole without having the least light or instruction from anybody"
 (King's Cam.,Keynes MS 130.10,fol. 2/v/) 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Numerous anecdotes exist on studying strategies, like the Feynman method explained <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/10/26/mastering-linear-algebra-in-10-days-astounding-experiments-in-ultra-learning/">here</a> "If you can’t, out loud or on paper, explain the idea without confusion or contradiction, stop and figure it out right there". There's some books that model that method, like Gilbert Strang's <i>Calculus</i> has you reciting back the entire chapter you just read if you do the exercises. 
</p>

<p>
If you ignore the copious amounts of marketing on his site, Cal Newport has some other interesting anecdotes on studying, such as how he was able to get the <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/11/25/case-study-how-i-got-the-highest-grade-in-my-discrete-math-class/">best</a> grade in his Discrete Mathematics class, and the rest of the site is full of advice on studying, how to schedule yourself and <a href="https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/">deliberate</a> <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/06/the-grandmaster-in-the-corner-office-what-the-study-of-chess-experts-teaches-us-about-building-a-remarkable-life/">practice</a>. 
</p>

<p>
My personal advice is just pick something you want to learn and divide and conquer, split that goal up into pieces you can accomplish in small steps. If you come across something that is assumed knowledge from a previous course research it a little and move on, you can always go back later if that thing becomes necessary. For example a typical undergrad textbook on calculus has you manipulating seemingly countless trig identities in the exercises so if you don't remember or know trig find a <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/dkatz/trigbootcamp/">crash course</a> and you will eventually pick it up as you go through the text you want to learn.

 "So I went to Case, and the Dean of Case says to us, it's a all men's school, "Men, look at, look to the person on your left, and the person on your right. One of you isn't going to be here next year; one of you is going to fail." So I get to Case, and again I'm studying all the time, working really hard on my classes, and so for that I had to be kind of a machine.
 In high school, our math program wasn't much, and I had never heard of calculus until I got to college. But the calculus book that we had was (in college) was great, and in the back of the book there were supplementary problems that weren't assigned by the teacher. So this was a famous calculus text by a man named George Thomas (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HJTYVOE94R83/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0201077795">second edition</a>), and I mention it especially because it was one of the first books published by Addison-Wesley, and I loved this calculus book so much that later I chose Addison-Wesley to be the publisher of my own book.
 Our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that (from the book). I would also do the odd numbered problems. In the back of Thomas's book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn't assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was scared I wouldn't learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. 
 But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that <i>I could just coast in mathematics, because I'd learned how to solve problems</i>"
(<a href="https://github.com/kragen/knuth-interview-2006">Don Knuth</a> )
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The best and proven way to gain all the background needed to jump into some university courses is to simply obtain all the books in the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/store">Art of Problem Solving</a> curriculum. Many are on library genesis in some scanned or screenshot form. Some of the psets in these books like their Calculus text are taken from math competitions they are not typical high school math texts. 
</p>

<p>
The second is <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/math.html">math from scratch</a> where I will eventually try 21st century mathematics like using the Lean proof assistant and univalence axiom/type theory as math foundations, and some modernized linear algebra and calculus content.

Prof Prabhakar Ragde of Waterloo has created a <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FICS/index.html">course</a> (second part <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flane/FICS2/">here</a>) in Racket which is like having an advanced personal tutor teach you introductory CS. There is a lot of basic math examples to demonstrate closures and other concepts but these are worth figuring out too because then you learn to see the same concept in two different models. If it looks intimidating try <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flane/TYR/">teach yourself Racket</a> a short intro. He describes these as 'flaneries' meaning a stroll through a topic which is more advanced than a blog post but shorter than a book. There is a lot of advanced material here for a beginners course.

"[Computer science] is not really about computers - and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes&#x2026;and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments. Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use."

It says 'advanced' but I found many of the lectures are approachable and anyone can do this.

First <a href="https://youtu.be/AlkDbnbv7dk">learn</a> what happens when you type a URL into your browser. Second <a href="https://youtu.be/7AMRfNKwuYo">learn</a> how a streaming site like Twitch/YouTube works. Finally <a href="https://youtu.be/an8SrFtJBdM">platform engineering</a> which means internal software-as-a-system (SaaS) so all teams share tooling that automates docker container deployment, analytics, multiple versions of apps with price-different features etc., anything that is common with all teams they will make internal tooling for it. Platform engineers are product designers for coworkers really who enable 'workflows' between teams and write infrastructure-as-code APIs. This is roughly the modern setup of most web app outfits. 
</p>

<p>
The titles involved constantly change for example you probably won't find 'front end' or 'back end' titles anymore there's just Product Design/Engineer or Software Engineer and designers are now some kind of sales and marketing pro with UX/UI skills that tell some software engineer how everything should look while taking into account 'multiple stakeholders'. Full stack devs aren't even called full stack anymore they're now just software engineers with the expectation they will be able to or learn how to code everything from platform automation to ETL (extract, transform, load) data pipelines to implementing whatever design is given to them.
</p>

<p>
So to learn web development in 2023 you're really somebody who knows a language that runs on Node.js like Typescript, who has a basic exposure to distributed computing concepts, who has some experience with Azure/AWS/GCP and Docker, who knows CSS frameworks, who can ETL data and who can automate this all by creating an internal product platform for deployment and everything else like monitoring and analytics. That is basically modern web development so now you know what to research yourself and practice. If you already have done an <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/software.html">intro</a> course it won't be hard to pick up on your own or on <a href="https://www.workatastartup.com/">the job</a>.

MIT's 6.S063 course <a href="https://designftw.mit.edu/schedule/">here</a> has some nice slides and if you scroll to the bottom of MIT's 2018 6.170 course <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa18/6.170/materials.html">here</a> taught by Daniel Jackson you will find 6 lectures all which are kind of amazing. UX Design/Heuristics and Conceptual Design lectures plus his new <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/daniel-jackson-on-the-essence-of-software">book</a> <i>The Essence of Software</i> are very good at teaching software design and I use the ideas there on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
As a trivial example of what a concept is: open up any random Airbnb <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/5302651?check_in=2023-09-18&amp;check_out=2023-09-23&amp;guests=1&amp;adults=1&amp;s=67&amp;unique_share_id=3e05ad0b-e8be-423b-8904-f272e736a36d">listing</a> and notice there's an icon/box that says 'Show all photos'. That is a concept: the show all photos concept. It seems reusable and people are already familiar with it so that's exactly what Vrbo has too, a similar concept on their listings where the last photo on the listing picture collage invites you to click to see more. When you click on show all photos in Airbnb you always get a single page with different preview sizes, another concept. When you click on show all photos on Vrbo however the full preview is skipped and you proceed immediately to a concept of a carousel of full sized photos you have to manually swipe through to see them all. Clearly the Airbnb concept is much better and that is what conceptual design is and in his book/lectures he goes through analytical methods which are easy tests to do so you aren't creating bad concepts. An example of confusing/misfit behavior would be Google's Gmail tags and he walks through why this is. Look how the Norweigan Broadcasting company designs <a href="https://tv.nrk.no/">NRK TV</a> even if you don't speak the language you instantly know what every feature does like choosing which episode to watch. 
</p>

<p>
So if you want to get into product design, you would read his book and redesign software like they did redesigning git into <a href="https://gitless.com/">gitless</a> by simply building wrappers around existing git commands that make sense. You would also need to learn tools like <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> and take some kind of <a href="https://gelp.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/Public%20-%206.S979%20Syllabus%20-%20Spring%202020%20copy.pdf">multi-stakeholder negotiation</a> content for example MIT recommends <a href="https://lawrencesusskind.mit.edu/good-you-great-me-finding-trading-zone-and-winning-win-win-negotiation">this book</a> because if you are designing something you are working with developers, sales, bosses, other businesses as customers or sometimes industry regulators all at once.

Try Sussman's new <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility">book</a> <i>Software Design for Flexibility</i> you only need the appendix on Scheme to start, most of this is self-contained, assumes you know the equivalent of his other book <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> or a CS19 style <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/software.html">intro course</a>.

I recommend checking local schools and labs in your area for research programmer positions, students often do not apply to these campus jobs as they are chasing internships and it's where I got started.

<p>
To build a modern portfolio I would simply make a bunch of fancy dashboards running in the browser on localhost/node and upload them to Github. This is harder than it seems they invented <a href="https://fly.io/blog/how-we-got-to-liveview/">Phoenix Liveview</a> for this and <a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/bonsai/">Bonsai</a>. Almost every software I'm forced to use at work and everything we make now at work has some kind of dashboard so you can't go wrong. There is often bounties on gitcoin or bountysource for dashboards/command center type UIs as well.

<p>
You can also contribute to the <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/">GNU Bug Tracker</a> because why not, it's free education plus a portfolio of commits and you get to make sure free software keeps running such as GUIX System an implementation of NixOS but with (I find) better features. You just get involved and figure it out as you go, there is no hard set of requirements see this <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2021-03/msg00018.html">post</a> by one of the maintainers of Automake: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
FWIW, I knew essentially nothing about the Automake implementation when I started, and still don't know much. To begin, I read the setup info available in the repository, asked questions of friends and lists when needed, got a build working and did some easy reports (e.g., tweak the manual), and went from there. It all takes considerable time; there is no royal road, as far as I know.

<p>
The absolute best set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPW2keNyw-usgvmR7FTQ3ZRjfLs5jT4BO">lectures</a> I have ever found are for the free <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/">book</a> <i>Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms</i>. You don't need anything else for an introduction this teaches the core learning theory that's never going to change and everything else like DL or NLP is a subset of the theory. In the lectures he explains all the math and proofs walking through them there is no prereqs except <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85AMigTyprOuf__daeklnLse">basic probability and stats</a> you can refer to if needed.

Sussman's grad <a href="https://ai6034.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=6.S966:_A_Graduate_Section_for_6.034#Prospectus">course</a> is the perfect match to CS188 reviewing older papers with unsolved problems or deep ideas, like his own <i>Art of the Propagator</i> paper and <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/propagators/">implementation</a>.
